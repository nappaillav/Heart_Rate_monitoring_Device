10 heartbeat time series in this directory: 5 young subjects
(denoted as Y1.txt, Y2.txt, etc) and 5 elderly subjects (O1.txt,
O2.txt, etc).

Each file contains 1 column data of interbeat interval (in second).
The length of the recording is approximately 2 hours for each subject.

For detailed description of the database, see
